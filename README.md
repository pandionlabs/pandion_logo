# Pandion Labs logo

## Exported version


## Editable version

The editable version differs from the exported svg as:

- the text is an editable text element and not a path (you need to have the fotn installed in your system to properly render the logo)
- there an hidden layer for the circle guide
- contains the inkscape metadata

## Design details

- the logo uses Montserrant extra bold as the font
- the size of the logo compared to the full image is optimized so that it still works with a circular crop
